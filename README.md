# Family Face Finder
Thank You for Your Purchase!

Family Face Finder is a simple and fun app designed for young children. Here’s how to get started:

Tap the menu icon at the top right of the screen.
Grant the app access to your photo library, then add photos of your family and friends.
After adding each photo, enter that person's name.
Add as many photos as you'd like!
When you're ready to play, hit the SPIN button to start the fun. The name bar at the bottom of the screen slides left and right, so you can view names that aren’t immediately visible.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at vendorhelperapp@gmail.com.

Have a great time enjoying Family Face Finder!
